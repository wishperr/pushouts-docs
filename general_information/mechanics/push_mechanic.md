# Push Mechanic

The push mechanic is a core gameplay element in Pushouts that allows players to knock opponents out of the arena.

## Characteristics
- Variable force based on charge duration
- Distance-based effectiveness
- Strategic timing element

## Implementation Details
- Players can charge attacks to increase push force
- Push effectiveness varies based on:
  - Charge duration
  - Distance to target
  - Timing of release
  - Opponent's survival time (affected by knockback scaling)

## Strategic Considerations
- Charging longer provides more force but leaves player vulnerable
- Position and timing are crucial for effective pushes
- Can be combined with dash mechanic for advanced strategies
