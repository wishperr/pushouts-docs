# Knockback Scaling

## Overview
Knockback scaling is a dynamic mechanic that increases player vulnerability based on survival time, creating more intense late-game scenarios.

## Scaling System
- Players become more vulnerable to knockback over time
- Scales with match duration and survival time
- Creates natural match progression
- Prevents excessive stalemates

## Strategic Impact
- Early game allows defensive play
- Mid-game requires careful positioning
- Late game forces aggressive action
- Rewards active gameplay styles

## Implementation
- Gradual increase in knockback received
- Visual indicators of current vulnerability
- Applies to all push interactions
- Resets on new matches

## Balance Considerations
- Universal application to all players
- Predictable scaling rate
- Clear feedback to players
- Interaction with other mechanics
