# Health System

## Base Mechanics
- Players start with 100 health points
- Health is lost when outside the arena
- Reaching 0 health results in elimination

## Dynamic Health Loss Rates
The game features a unique escalating health loss system:
- Initial rate: 1 health per second
- After 60 seconds: Accelerates to 1 health per 250ms
- This mechanic creates increasing pressure as matches progress

## Strategic Implications
- Early game allows for more risky plays outside the arena
- Mid-game requires more careful positioning
- Late game becomes intensely tactical due to rapid health loss
- Players must balance aggression with arena positioning

## Recovery & Mechanics Interaction
- No health regeneration
- Synergizes with knockback scaling to create dynamic late-game scenarios
- Forces players to stay active and engaged in combat
