# Arena Boundaries

## Boundary Mechanics
- Health loss begins immediately when crossing boundary
- Initial rate: 1 health per second
- Accelerates to 1 health per 250ms after 60 seconds
- Clear visual and audio feedback when crossing boundary

## Strategic Elements
- Risk vs. reward decisions for boundary plays
- Late-game pressure from accelerated health loss
- Recovery possibilities through quick returns
- Tactical pushes towards boundaries

## Boundary Interactions
- Push effects amplified near boundaries
- Dash can save players from boundary
- Knockback scaling affects boundary recovery
- Team positioning near boundaries

## Visual Indicators
- Boundary line visibility
- Health loss warning effects
- Time-based danger indicators
- Distance-based warning system
