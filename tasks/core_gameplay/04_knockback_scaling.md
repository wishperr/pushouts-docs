# Task: Implement Knockback Scaling System

## Objective
Create a dynamic knockback scaling system that increases player vulnerability based on survival time.

## Requirements
- Progressive knockback increase over time
- Per-player scaling tracking
- Visual vulnerability indicators
- Network state synchronization
- Reset on new matches

## Technical Details
- Survival time tracking
- Knockback multiplier calculation
- Visual feedback system
- State management per player
- Network state sync

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Knockback increases consistently with time
- [ ] Each player has individual scaling
- [ ] Clear visual feedback of current vulnerability
- [ ] Proper reset between matches
- [ ] Accurate network synchronization
- [ ] Balanced scaling curve

## Dependencies
- Push mechanic
- Match state system
- Player state tracking

## Estimated Time
- 2-3 days
