# Task: Implement Character Base System

## Objective
Create the foundational character system that defines base character attributes, abilities, and state management.

## Requirements
- Character Framework
  * Base character class
  * Attribute system
  * State machine
  * Animation system
  * Ability framework
  * Character switching

- Character Components
  * Base stats (speed, size, etc.)
  * Push force modifiers
  * Dash characteristics
  * Special abilities
  * Visual components
  * Sound components

- Character States
  * Idle state
  * Moving state
  * Charging state
  * Dashing state
  * Knocked back state
  * Eliminated state

- Character Management
  * Character pooling
  * Instance management
  * State synchronization
  * Resource optimization
  * Memory management
  * Character swapping
