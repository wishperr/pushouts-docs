# Task: Implement Base Push Mechanic

## Objective
Implement the core push mechanic that allows players to charge and release pushes with variable force.

## Requirements
- Push force varies based on charge duration
- Push effectiveness changes with distance
- Push direction matches player aim
- Visual feedback during charging
- Hit detection and collision handling

## Technical Details
- Input system for charge/release
- Force calculation formula
- Physics-based push implementation
- Network synchronization of push events
- Client-side prediction

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Push force is consistent at same charge levels
- [ ] Distance affects push power appropriately
- [ ] Visual charge indicator is clear
- [ ] Push direction matches player input
- [ ] Network latency handled smoothly
- [ ] Hit detection is accurate

## Dependencies
- Basic player movement
- Arena boundaries
- Physics system

## Estimated Time
- 3-4 days

## Priority
P0 - Core Mechanic
