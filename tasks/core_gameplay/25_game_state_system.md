# Task: Implement Game State System

## Objective
Create a centralized game state management system that handles all game states, transitions, and data flow between different systems.

## Requirements
- State Management
  * Game session states
  * Match states
  * Player states
  * UI states
  * Network states
  * System states

- State Features
  * State machine implementation
  * State transitions
  * State validation
  * State persistence
  * State synchronization
  * State recovery

- Data Flow
  * Inter-system communication
  * Event dispatching
  * State updates
  * Data validation
  * Change notification
  * State rollback

- State Types
  * Menu state
  * Loading state
  * Match state
  * Results state
  * Shop state
  * Social state

## Technical Details
