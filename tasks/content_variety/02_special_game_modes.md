# Task: Implement Special Game Modes

## Objective
Implement the special objective-based game modes: Push the Ball, King of the Hill, and Capture the Crown.

## Requirements
- Push the Ball Mode
  * Ball physics and interaction
  * Team scoring system
  * Ball position tracking
  * Push force effects on ball
  
- King of the Hill Mode
  * Control zone mechanics
  * Point accumulation system
  * Zone contestation
  * Visual zone indicators
  
- Capture the Crown Mode
  * Crown holder mechanics
  * Enhanced push power for holder
  * Crown transfer system
  * Score tracking
