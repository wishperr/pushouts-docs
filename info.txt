### Key Points
- Implement a balanced progression system with XP earned from matches to level up and unlock characters or cosmetics.
- Ensure all characters are equally powerful with unique playstyles to avoid unfair advantages.
- Use skill-based matchmaking to pair players of similar abilities, not progression levels.
- Offer casual and ranked modes for fair competition and fun experimentation.
- Encourage progression with diverse characters and cosmetic options, regularly updating for balance.

---

### How to Implement the Progression System

**Overview**  
The progression system in "Pushouts" should reward players with experience points (XP) for playing matches, allowing them to level up and unlock new characters or customization options. This system must be fair for lower-level players while motivating them to aim for higher levels.

**Balanced Character Design**  
All characters should have the same overall power level, with unique abilities that cater to different playstyles. For example, one character might have a stronger push, while another has a faster dash. This ensures no character is inherently better, keeping the game fair. Regular testing and player feedback will help maintain this balance, adjusting abilities as needed.

**Skill-Based Matchmaking**  
Implement a matchmaking system, like a hidden Matchmaking Rating (MMR) or visible rank, that pairs players based on skill, not their level. This means a lower-level player with fewer unlocks can still compete fairly against higher-level players of similar skill, ensuring balanced matches.

**Separate Progression and Skill Systems**  
The leveling system (unlocking characters) should be separate from competitive rankings. Players earn XP from both wins and participation, leveling up to unlock new characters or cosmetic items. Their competitive rank, however, is based on match performance, not progression, keeping ranked play fair.

**Game Modes for Fairness and Fun**  
Offer two modes:  
- **Casual Mode:** Players can use any unlocked characters for fun and experimentation, with relaxed matching.  
- **Ranked Mode:** Focuses on competitive play with strict skill-based matching, ensuring fair competition.  

This allows lower-level players to enjoy the game without pressure, while ranked mode ensures balanced high-level play.

**Encouraging Progression**  
To motivate players, ensure new characters offer variety, like different strategies or themes, making them appealing to unlock. Cosmetic options, like skins or emotes, should be purely aesthetic and not affect gameplay. Regular updates will keep the system engaging, encouraging players to return and progress.

### Survey Note: Detailed Implementation of the Progression System in "Pushouts"

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of implementing a progression system in "Pushouts," a 2D mobile multiplayer arena battle game, ensuring fairness for lower-level players while encouraging progression to higher levels. The goal is to align with mobile gaming trends, such as those seen in Brawl Stars, where character diversification drives retention ([Game Analysis: How Supercell sparked a Brawl Stars resurgence](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/game-analysis-how-supercell-sparked-a-brawl-stars-resurgence/)).

#### Background and Game Context
"Pushouts" involves players competing in a circular arena, using strategic movement, dashes, and charged pushes to knock opponents out of bounds, with the last player standing winning. The game supports 2-8 players in free-for-all and team modes (2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4). The proposed progression system involves earning XP from matches to level up and unlock new characters or customization options, aiming for at least 15 minutes of daily play, five days a week.

#### Design Principles for Fairness and Engagement
To ensure the progression system does not create an unbalanced or unfair experience for lower-level players while encouraging them to aim for higher levels, the following principles are derived from industry best practices and game design theory:

1. **Balanced Character Design**  
   - All characters must be balanced in terms of their overall power level to prevent any character from being strictly superior, which could disadvantage lower-level players.  
   - Characters should have unique abilities that offer different playstyles, such as a character with a stronger push versus one with a faster dash, ensuring variety without imbalance.  
   - Regular testing and player feedback are essential, as highlighted in [Game Balance: A Definitive Guide](https://gamedesignskills.com/game-design/game-balance/), to adjust abilities and maintain competitive balance. This involves monitoring win rates, usage rates, and player sentiment to identify and address any overpowered or underpowered characters.  
   - Example: If a new character has a unique dash ability, ensure its push resistance is adjusted to balance its overall impact, preventing it from dominating matches.

2. **Skill-Based Matchmaking**  
   - Implement a matchmaking system based on player skill, such as a hidden Matchmaking Rating (MMR) or a visible ranking system, as discussed in [Competitive Balance - TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance). This ensures players are paired with others of similar ability, regardless of their progression level.  
   - For instance, a lower-level player with fewer unlocked characters can still compete fairly against a higher-level player if their skill levels are comparable, mitigating the advantage of having more options.  
   - The system can use metrics like win/loss ratios, kill/death ratios, or performance in matches to calculate MMR, ensuring matches are balanced and enjoyable for all players.  
   - This approach is crucial in competitive games to prevent "pay-to-win" perceptions, as noted in [Why Balance Is So Important In A Competitive Video Game](https://ggn00b.com/for-noobs/why-does-balance-matter-video-games/), where imbalance can lead to player churn.

3. **Separate Progression and Skill Systems**  
   - The progression system (leveling and unlocking) should be decoupled from the competitive ranking system to maintain fairness. Players earn XP from participating in matches, with potential bonuses for wins, kills, or other achievements, as seen in games like Fortnite's battle pass system.  
   - Leveling up unlocks new characters or cosmetic customization options, providing a sense of achievement and motivation, aligning with [The Balancing Act of Randomness in Competitive Games](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/the-balancing-act-of-randomness-in-competitive-games), which emphasizes rewarding progression without gameplay advantages.  
   - Competitive rank, however, is based solely on match performance, ensuring that a player's level does not directly influence their competitive standing. This separation prevents higher-level players from having an inherent advantage in ranked play.  
   - Example: A level 10 player with many unlocks but poor performance would have a low rank, matching them with similarly skilled players, not higher-level ones.

4. **Game Modes for Fairness and Fun**  
   - Introduce casual and ranked modes to cater to different player needs. Casual mode allows players to use any unlocked characters for fun and experimentation, with relaxed matching, similar to Brawl Stars' friendly matches.  
   - Ranked mode focuses on competitive play, with strict skill-based matching based on MMR or rank, ensuring fair competition, as discussed in [Understanding Balance in Video Games](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/understanding-balance-in-video-games).  
   - This dual-mode approach ensures lower-level players can enjoy the game without pressure in casual mode, while ranked mode provides a balanced competitive environment. It also encourages progression by allowing players to test new unlocks in casual mode before using them in ranked play.  
   - Example: A new player can practice with a recently unlocked character in casual mode, gaining confidence before entering ranked matches.

5. **Encouraging Progression Through Variety and Rewards**  
   - To motivate players to aim for higher levels, ensure that unlocking new characters offers variety and appeal. Each character should have a distinct playstyle or thematic design, making them attractive to unlock, as seen in fighting games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate ([How to Unlock All Characters in Smash Bros. Ultimate - Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Guide - IGN](https://www.ign.com/wikis/super-smash-bros-ultimate/How_to_Unlock_All_Characters_in_Smash_Bros._Ultimate)).  
   - Cosmetic customization options, such as skins, emotes, or push effects, should be purely aesthetic and not affect gameplay balance, aligning with [r/Games on Reddit: Character unlocks in fighting games](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/zxssj/character_unlocks_in_fighting_games/). This ensures fairness while providing personalization, a key retention factor.  
   - Regular updates and new content, such as seasonal characters or limited-time cosmetics, can keep the progression system engaging, encouraging players to log in daily to earn XP and unlock rewards.  
   - Example: A new character with a ninja theme and quick dashes could appeal to players seeking agility, while a tank character with strong pushes might attract those preferring defensive play.

#### Implementation Details and Considerations
To operationalize these principles, consider the following detailed implementation:

- **XP System:** Start with a simple XP system where players earn XP for match participation (e.g., 50 XP per match), with bonuses for wins (e.g., +50 XP), kills (e.g., +10 XP per kill), or other achievements (e.g., +20 XP for most pushes). This ensures both casual and competitive players can progress, aligning with the 15-minute daily play goal.  
- **Leveling and Unlocks:** Tie unlocks to levels, such as unlocking a new character every 5 levels, with cosmetic options available at intermediate levels. Ensure the grind is not excessive by spacing unlocks reasonably, e.g., reaching level 10 in a week with regular play.  
- **Character Balancing Process:** Use a tier list approach, as suggested in [Game Balance: A Definitive Guide](https://gamedesignskills.com/game-design/game-balance/), to categorize characters and focus on balancing top-tier characters early, while reworking low-tier ones for niche roles. Regular patches can adjust abilities based on player data, such as win rates and usage statistics.  
- **Matchmaking Algorithm:** Develop an MMR system that updates after each match based on performance, using algorithms like TrueSkill, commonly used in games like Halo. Ensure casual mode has wider MMR ranges for quicker matching, while ranked mode has tighter ranges for competitive integrity.  
- **Monitoring and Adjustment:** Set up analytics to track player progression, match outcomes, and feedback, using tools like Unity Analytics or Google Play Games Services. Conduct quarterly balance updates based on data, ensuring the progression system remains fair and engaging.

#### Potential Challenges and Mitigations
- **Character Imbalance:** If a new character proves too strong, it could disadvantage lower-level players. Mitigate by rapid response patches and temporary nerfs, as seen in [Why Balance Is So Important In A Competitive Video Game](https://ggn00b.com/for-noobs/why-does-balance-matter-video-games/).  
- **Grind Perception:** If unlocking feels too grindy, players may disengage. Ensure XP rewards are sufficient for regular play, with events offering bonus XP to accelerate progression.  
- **Matchmaking Wait Times:** Strict skill-based matching in ranked mode could lead to long queue times. Offer incentives for playing during off-peak hours or implement cross-region matching with latency compensation.

#### Comparative Analysis with Industry Examples
- **Brawl Stars:** Players unlock brawlers through progression, with skill-based matching via trophy counts. This separates progression from competitive play, ensuring fairness, as noted in [Game Analysis: How Supercell sparked a Brawl Stars resurgence](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/game-analysis-how-supercell-sparked-a-brawl-stars-resurgence/).  
- **Fortnite:** Battle pass levels unlock cosmetics, with no gameplay advantage, maintaining balance, as discussed in [The Balancing Act of Randomness in Competitive Games](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/the-balancing-act-of-randomness-in-competitive-games).  
- **Super Smash Bros. Ultimate:** Character unlocks are tied to playtime, with balanced characters ensuring fairness, as per [How to Unlock All Characters in Smash Bros. Ultimate - Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Guide - IGN](https://www.ign.com/wikis/super-smash-bros-ultimate/How_to_Unlock_All_Characters_in_Smash_Bros._Ultimate).

#### Conclusion
By implementing a balanced progression system with skill-based matchmaking, separate competitive rankings, and diverse character unlocks, "Pushouts" can ensure fairness for lower-level players while encouraging progression. Regular updates and player feedback will maintain engagement, aligning with mobile gaming retention goals.
